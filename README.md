# JxStream
JxStream is a stream processing library built using Java Streams. The idea is to provide stream processing semantics while maintaining the same level of abstraction the Java Stream package provides. The initial source code was one of the by products of our Master thesis at [Chalmers University of technology](http://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx).
